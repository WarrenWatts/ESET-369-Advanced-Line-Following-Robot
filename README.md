# ESET-369-Advanced-Line-Following-Robot
My group project in ESET 369 for an Advanced Line Following Robot coded in C.

A few things need to be noted here that aren't already covered in the report, which contains a could chunk of information pertaining to this project. Firstly, the code provided is for Part B of this lab, since Part A only aided in the creation of some of the functions to be used in Part B, and Part C was only conceptual. Secondly, it is understood that coding in some areas could have been done more efficiently. However, when working with limited time and old, faulty hardware that makes it hard to distinguish if an error is being caused by the code or the hardware, our group decided it would be in our best interest to code it in such a manner.
